 PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST by Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio 
[view looking straight down at rolling swells, sound of wind and thunder, then a low heartbeat] 
Scene: [teacups on a table in the rain]
[sheet music on music stands in the rain]
[bouquet of white orchids, Elizabeth sitting in the rain holding the bouquet]
[men rowing, men on horseback, to the sound of thunder]
[logo on flag blowing in the wind]
[many rowboats are entering the harbor]
[Elizabeth sitting alone, at a distance]
[marines running, kick a door in]
[a mule is seen on the left in the barn where the marines enter]
[Liz looking over her shoulder]
[Elizabeth drops her bouquet]
[Will is in manacles, being escorted by red coats] 
Will,,,
!
[Elizabeth runs to Will] 
Why is this happening?
I don't know.
You look beautiful.
I think it's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding.
[marines cross their long axes to bar Governor from entering]
[Beckett, in white hair and curls, is standing with Mercer] 
Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been too long.
His Lord now,,,
actually.
In fact, I *do*.
Mister Mercer!
The warrant for the arrest of one William Turner.
Oh, is it?
That's annoying.
My mistake.
Arrest her.
On what charges?
No!
[Beckett takes another document from Mercer, who is standing with Beckett, craggy face and pony tail] 
Ah-ha!
Here's the one for William Turner.
And I have another one for a Mister James Norrington.
Is he present?
*What are the charges?
* I don't believe that's the answer to the question I asked.
Lord Beckett!
In the category of questions *not* answered,,,
We are under the jurisdiction of the King's governor of Port Royal, and you will tell us what we are charged with.
For which the punishment, regrettably, is *also* death.
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.
*Captain* Jack Sparrow.
Captain Jack Sparrow.
Yes, I thought you might.
Scene: [views of rigging ropes and blocks aboard a ship at night]
[Gibbs walks the deck alone at night, singing and drinking from a bottle] 
Fifteen men on a dead man's chest.
Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum.
Drink and the devil had done for the rest.
Yo ho ho, and a *bottle* of rum.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
[a bell tolls, Gibbs is interrupted from his drinking by the sound]
[Gibbs looks up to see a flock of crows flying in the foggy night sky] 
Scene: [tolling of bells, camera pans to show the crows flying toward a coastal island]
[pinnacle-like island off the coast at night, connected to the mainland by thin, lighted bridge]
[cages with men inside line the bridge]
[prisoners are being marched across the bridge]
[a male prisoner with bloody legs is muttering, and is dragged across the bridge by guards]
[a crow is seen reflected in the eye of one male prisoner in a cage, the crow attacks and pecks his eye out, he screams]
[the prisoner who was being dragged is taken down a hatch-like door in the ground, he also screams]
[rocky shoreline, lit with torches]
[men toss caskets into the sea]
[numerous caskets are floating out to sea, vertical streaks in the distant clouds are seen]
[a crow lands on one casket, begins pecking at the top]
[sudden gunblast from inside the casket blows the crow away, along with much wood]
[hand holding flintlock pistol emerges, pans about, points it at audience for a moment]
[Jack breaks out of the top of the casket, puts his captain's hat on] 
Sorry, mate.
[Jack breaks the skeleton's leg off] 
Mind if we make a little side trip?
I didn't think so.
[Jack uses the skeleton leg as an oar, rows toward the full moon and a waiting ship in the distance to the right of the moon] 
Scene: [Jack arrives at the Black Pearl in his coffin rowboat]
[Gibbs holds out his hand to help Jack aboard, Jack puts the skeleton leg in Gibbs' hand]
[Cotton drapes a coat onto Jack's back] 
Not *quite* according to plan.
Complications arose, ensued, were overcome.
You got what you went in for, then?
Mm-hmm!
Captain, I think the crew, meaning me as well, were expecting something a bit more,,,
*shiny*.
What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed by the sea, and the treasure with it.
And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the Atlantic.
And the hurricane!
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
All in all, it's seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating.
Shiny?
Aye, shiny.
Is that how you're all feeling, then?
Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain?
 Awk!
Walk the plank!
[Jack grabs his pistol and points it at the bird] 
What did the bird say?
Do not blame the bird.
Show us what is on that piece of cloth there.
[the monkey snarls, seizes the cloth, scampers off with it] 
Ohhh!
[Jack attempts to shoot the monkey with his pistol, his pistol misfires]
[Jack grabs a pistol from another crewman and blasts the monkey while it's on the deck]
[the monkey drops the cloth, but is unharmed, and scurries into the rigging] 
Know that don't do no good.
It does me.
[Marty picks up the cloth that the monkey dropped] 
It's a key!
No!
Much more better.
It is a *drawing* of a key.
[Jack holds up the cloth, the crew crowd forward]
[Among the crew: Chinese man, black man with a black beard, white bearded man with large black hat] 
Gentlemen, what do keys do?
Keys,,,
unlock,,,
*things*?
And whatever this key unlocks, *inside* there's something valuable.
So, we're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks!
No!
If we don't have the key, we can't open whatever it is we don't have that it unlocks.
So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked, which we don't have, without first having found the key what unlocks it?
So - We're going after this key!
You're not making any sense at all.
Any more questions?
So,,,
Do we have a heading?
Hah!
A heading.
Set sail in a,,,
mmm,,,
a general,,,
in *that* way - direction.
Cap'n?
Come on, snap to and make sail, you know how this works.
Come on, oy/quick, oy/quick, hey!
[Marty and Gibbs gather alone by the railing] 
Have you noticed lately,,,
The captain seems to be actin' a bit strange,,,
-er.
Settin' sail without knowing his own headin'?
Somethin's got Jack vexed.
Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all.
[the Black Pearl is shown at night in a thunderstorm] 
Scene: ROYAL: [a painter is painting a detail on a mural of a world map]
[a guard brings Will in manacles into Beckett's office] 
Lord Beckett.
The prisoner as ordered, Sir.
Those won't be necessary.
[Will's manacles are removed]
[Beckett pours some liquor] 
The East India Trading Company has need of your services.
We wish for you to act as our agent in a business transaction with our mutual friend: Captain Sparrow.
More acquaintance than friend.
How do you know him?
We've had dealings in the past.
And we've each left our mark,,,
on the other.
What mark did he leave on you?
By your efforts Jack Sparrow was set free.
I would like you to go to him, and recover a certain property in his possession.
Recover.
At the point of a sword?
*Bargain*!
[Beckett goes over to a wooden box on a table and opens it] 
Letters of Marque.
You will offer what amounts to a full pardon.
Jack will be free, a privateer in the employ of England.
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment the same as being free.
Freedom.
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.
The world is shrinking, the blank pages of the map filled in.
Jack must find his place in the new world or perish.
Not unlike you, Mister Turner.
You and your fiancEe face the hangman's noose.
So you get both Jack *and* the Black Pearl.
The Black Pearl?
The property you want that he possesses.
A ship?
Hardly.
The item in question's considerably smaller and far more valuable.
Something Sparrow keeps on his person at all times.
A compass.
Ah, you know it.
Bring back that Compass, or there's no deal.
Scene: [Jack is using calipers on a map, using his left hand, a "P" brand mark is seen on his right arm]
[an hourglass is in the background, Jack taps the Compass]
[Jack looks in his bottle, turns the bottle upside-down, only a few drops spill out] 
Why is the rum always gone?
[Jack rises to his feet, staggers]
[Jack picks up his hat off the top of a globe] 
Oh!
*That's* why.
[Jack walks past the crew sleeping on hammocks, Jack is carrying a lantern]
[some of the crew are snoring, and Cotton is among those sleeping] 
As you were, gents.
[Jack goes downstairs to the hold, an animal bleats, Jack unlocks the door, goes in]
[Jack sees eerie filter feeder creatures festooning a beam of wood]
[Jack spots a rack of bottles, with the bottles stored sideways like in a wine rack] 
Ah!
[Jack pulls a sideways bottle from the rack]
[Jack pours sand out of the bottle]
[Jack drops bottle of rum in fright, the bottle breaks on the floor]
[Jack walks over to see who spoke] 
Bootstrap.
Bill Turner.
[Bootstrap looks up from where he's sitting on a barrel, crabs scuttle across his face] 
Is this a dream?
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.
[Bootstrap immediately hands Jack a bottle of rum]
[Jack pries the bottle from Bootstrap's hand with a crackling sound] 
I had some help retrieving the Pearl, by the way.
[Jack tinks the lip of the bottle with his fingers, then blows across the top of the bottle] 
Your son.
[Jack takes a drink from the bottle] 
And to what do I owe the pleasure of your carbuncle?
Who?
Ah.
So it's you, then.
He shanghaied you into service, eh?
[a small hermit crab scuttles by Bootstrap, on top of the barrel where Bootstrap sits]
[Bootstrap grabs the hermit crab, pops it into his mouth, and crunches on it]
[Jack moves his mouth, jaw, and tongue around in revulsion while watching]
[Jack hands the bottle back to Bootstrap] It's funny what a man will do to forestall his final judgment - [Jack starts to walk off, but Bootstrap stands up at the same time and intercepts Jack, blocking him] 
Technic - Yes, but the Flying Dutchman already *has* a captain, so there's re - Any idea when Jones might release said terrible beastie?
[Jack looks at the palm of his left hand, where a black spot boils into view]
[Jack looks up, but Bootstrap has disappeared] Scene: PEARL: [Jack runs across a wooden deck that has a shallow covering of water] 
On deck all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!
On deck!
Scurry!
Scurry-on/Marty, I want movement!
*I want movement!
*  Lift the skin up!
All on deck!
Run!
And keep running!
Run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us!
Do we have a heading?
Ah!
Ooh!
Run!
Land.
[Jack rises from where he was ducked behind the base of the mast, sees Gibbs again] 
Oh!
Euh!
Which port?
Didn't say port.
I said land.
Any land.
[the monkey in skeleton form swings down, grabs Jack's hat] 
Agh!
[the monkey snarls at Jack, Jack snarls back at the monkey, in imitation]
[the monkey throws Jack's hat overboard] 
Jack's hat!
Bring 'er about!
No no!
Leave it!
Run!
Back to your stations!
The lot o' ya!
[Jack stands stiffly in the shadows under some steps, between two lighted windows]
[Gibbs walks up to Jack] 
Jack?
Shhh!
For the love of mother and child, Jack, what's coming after us?
Nothing.
Scene: small fishing vessel [Jack's hat floats toward a small fishing vessel around sunrise]
[a Turkish crewmember pulls Jack's hat out of the water with a hook]
[the first sailor tries the hat on, jokingly pretending to be a captain] 
Heh-heh-heh.
tupayHey!
Fo pes sa kapazun kapitan de la mezande, huh?
Etora.
Fetsoran ipitos.
Ferinte.
arrive, huh?
[the Greek sailor takes the hat, tries it on next] 
Ah!
Vangas da eroro ### [a large object is seeing moving underwater toward their vessel, creating a disturbance on the ocean surface as it moves] 
kapitan ### Scene: ### [a loud thumping sound occurs, the two sailors freeze in fright]
[a third sailor sleeps on deck]
[one sailor presses the hat against the other's chest, indicating he doesn't want it anymore] 
Scene: Port Royal prison [Will and the governor rapidly descend stone steps into the prison]
[the guard at the bottom of the steps holds a long gun with a bayonette on the end] 
Here now.
He can't be here.
Mister Swann, - Jack's Compass.
What does Beckett want with that?
Does it matter?
I'm to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal.
In exchange the charges against us will be dropped.
Is that lack of faith in Jack, or in me?
I have faith in you.
Both of you.
Where will you find him?
Tortuga.
I'll start there, and I won't stop searching 'til I find him.
And then I intend to return here, to marry you.
Properly?
Eagerly, if you'll still have me.
If it weren't for these bars I'd have you already.
[the governor accidentally knocks a candleholder off the wall]
[the governor tosses the candleholder aside, onto the floor] 
I'll wait for you.
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.
[Will walks back up the prison steps] 
Scene: Tortuga *Captain* Jack Sparrow?
Owes me four dubloons.
Heard he was dead.
HALF- Singapore.
That's what I heard.
Drunk with a smile on his face.
Sure as the tide, Jack Sparrow,,,
will turn up in Singapore.
[Scarlett is a redhead, Giselle is a blonde, both are standing together, answering Will's questions] 
Jack Sparrow!
I haven't seen 'im in a month.
When you find him, will you give him a message?
[Giselle slaps Will in the face]
[a black man who is a shrimper is sitting on a dock, mending his nets]
[in the background is a bunch of bananas on the dock, and a goat being loaded aboard a ship] 
Cannot say about Jack Sparrow.
But dere's a island, just south of de straits, where I trade spice for,,,
mmm,,,
delicious long pork.
Cannot say about Jack.
But you find a ship dere.
A ship wit' black sails.
Scene: ISLAND: beach [Black Pearl seen stranded on a beach, through a spyglass] 
My brother will take you ashore.
[the shrimper's brother is rowing Will toward the shore]
[the rower stops rowing] 
What's wrong?
The beach is right there.
 ?
: Ne bougeais pas, c'est trop dangereux.
What?
 ?
: Je ne peux, c'est trop dangereux, j'avais le dit.
Bon voyage, monsieur.
[Will jumps off the rowboat, swims ashore, wearing his sword]
[aerial view, flying over jungle toward beach, showing Will wading ashore]
[Will walks alongside the Black Pearl, which is tied with ropes to stakes in the sand] 
Jack!
Jack Sparrow!
Marty!
Cotton!
Anybody?
[Will wanders into the palm jungle bordering the beach]
[Cotton's parrot flutters up and lands atop a palm stump] 
 Awk!
Ah!
A familiar face!
 Rawk!
Don't eat me!
I'm not gonna eat you.
 Don't eat me!
No!
Don't eat me!
Akkk!
[Will finds Gibbs' husk canteen hanging on a plant, trailing a long string] 
Gibbs.
[Will follows the string attached to the canteen, over toward a large tree]
[human eyes open in the background, from a man camouflaged against a nearby tree]
[the camouflaged cannibal shouts and jumps out from the tree at Will]
[Will is yanked back by a snare, and dangles upside-down from a rope]
[cannibals charge out of the bushes from all directions, Will keeps them at bay with his sword] 
Euh!
Unh!
Ya!
Come on!
Let's go!
Euh!
Ya!
Come on!
Who wants it?
Unh!
I could do this all day!
Euh!
Euh!
Hah!
[a cannibal with a bone through his nose uses a blowgun to shoot a dart into Will's neck]
[Will drops his sword to the ground] 
Scene: ISLAND: throne [aerial view of flying over the island's mountaintops, toward hilltop throne area]
[Will is carried while hung from a bamboo pole, his head hanging back]
[human skulls line the path along which Will is taken]
[Will is carried over a roap bridge]
[one cannibal is wearing an English white wig and using a Western style fan] 
?
: Hurry-hurry tan daga!
[Will is brought before Jack, who sits on a throne]
[the music stops, Jack pops his eyes open, revealing that his closed eyelids were painted to look like open eyes] 
Jack?
Jack Sparrow!
I can honestly say I'm glad to see you!
[Jack says nothing, arises from his throne, walks over to Will]
[Jack pushes one finger into Will's shoulder, as if testing how much meat Will has on him] 
Jack!
It's me!
Will Turner!
?
: Wa-say kohn.?
: Een dah-lah.
Eeseepi.
Eeseepi.
Tell 'em to let me down.
Kay-lay lam.
Lam piki-piki.
Lam eensy weensy.
Lam say-say,,,
eunuchy.
Snip-snip.
Ahhh,,,
eunuchy!
[Jack begins to walk away, as if disinterested, his Compass hangs from his waist] 
Jack!
The Compass!
That's all I need, Elizabeth is in danger.
We were arrested for trying to help *you*.
She faces the gallows!
[Jack halts, pauses, turns around and casually walks back] 
Say-say lam shoop-shoop sha smalay-lama shoo-koo.
Savvy?
Ball licky-licky.
Ball licky-licky!
Ball licky-licky!
[the cannibals begin chanting, repetitiously] 
Boom-shoo-boom, boom-shoo-boom, boom-shoo-boom,,,
Save me!
Jack, what did you tell them?
No!
What about Elizabeth?
*Jack,,,
!
* [Will is carried across a rope bridge, still hanging underneath the bamboo pole] Port Royal [Elizabeth sits alone in her prison cell, male prisoners in the next cell whistle and beckon her] 
,,,
we don't bite,,,
Come on,,,
Prisoners Where you goin',,,
?
) Why don't you tell me what's happening?
No!
Will has gone to find Jack!
He's a better man than you give him credit for.
[a horse and carriage are waiting, the governor opens the door to the carriage for Elizabeth] 
A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
[the horse and carriage quickly ride off]
[the horse and carriage arrive at a dock]
[Captain Hawkins stands silently on the dock facing out to sea]
[the captain's body soon falls, revealing Mercer, who was standing behind the body, long knife in hand] 
Evening, Governor.
Shame, huh?
He was carryin' this.
It's a letter to the King.
It's from *you*.
[horses and soldiers arrive to cut off the governor from fleeing from the dock]
[the carriage door is opened, but the carriage is empty, Elizabeth is gone] 
Where is she?
[Mercer grabs the governor by the lapels, pushes him up against the side of the carriage] 
headquarters [darkened room]
[Beckett walks in from the balcony, carrying a lantern]
[Beckett walks to a table, opens a wooden box, finds the Letters of Marque missing] 
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty is no longer the currency of the realm, as your father believes.
[Elizabeth slips into the dark room from an interior door, hands held behind her] 
Then what is?
I'm afraid that *currency* is the currency of the realm.
I expect then that we can come to some sort of understanding.
I'm here to negotiate.
I'm listening.
[Elizabeth pulls a pistol, points it at Beckett's head] 
I'm listening *intently*.
These Letters of Marque, they are signed by the King?
Yes, and they're not valid until they bear my signature and my seal.
Or else I would not still be here.
You sent Will to get you the Compass owned by Jack Sparrow.
It will do you no good.
Do explain.
I have been to Isla de Muerta, I have seen the treasure myself.
There is something you need to know.
Ah, I see.
*You* think the Compass leads only to the Isla de Muerta, and so you hope to *save* me from an evil fate.
But you mustn't worry.
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.
My desires are not so provincial.
There's more than one chest of value in these waters.
So perhaps you may wish to enhance your offer.
[Elizabeth cocks her pistol]
[Beckett signs the document] 
Consider into your calculations that you robbed me of my wedding night.
So I did.
A marriage interrupted.
Or fate intervenes.
You make great efforts to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.
These aren't going to Jack.
Oh really.
To ensure Mister Turner's freedom, then?
I'll still want that Compass.
Consider that in your calculations.
Longboat [Ragetti appears to be reading a Bible in the back of the longboat, but the Bible is upside-down] 
Well I say it was divine providence what escaped us from jail.
And I say,,,
it was me bein' *clever*.
Ain't that right, poochie?
[the dog goes to the bow, looking forward, keys in its mouth] 
?
: Well how'dya know it weren't/wasn't divine providence what inspired you to *be* clever?
Anyways, I ain't stealin' no ship.
It ain't stealin'.
It's *salvagin'*!
And since when did you care?
Since we're not immortal no more.
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.
You know you can't read.
It's the Bible.
You get credit for trying.
Pretendin' to read the Bible's a *lie*!
*That's* a mark against ya!
Look!
There it is!
[the dog jumps overboard and swims toward shore] 
What's got into *'im*?
Must've seen a catfish.
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.
[both laugh, the dog reaches shore and looks back at them] 
Stupid mongrel!
[the dog on shore shakes off water, looks back at them, still holding keys in its mouth]
[their boat capsizes in a wave, they wade ashore] 
Scene: ISLAND: beach Come on!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha-ha-ha,,,
### It's ours for the taking!
Tide's comin', that should help.
Well, salvagin' is saving, in a manner of speaking.
There's the truth of *it*!
### [cannibal drums sound] 
Suppose we be'er,,,
save it as soon as we can.
What with our souls in such a vulnerable state, and all.
Amen to that.
[the dog barks] 
Scene: ISLAND: throne [cannibal drums are pounding]
[Jack is on the throne, a cannibal hands Jack a necklace of human toes] 
Thank you.
[Jack looks at the toe, bites off part of the nail to trim it]
[Jack spits out the piece of nail, reexamines the toe] 
Scene: ISLAND: cages [two spherical cages of six Black Pearl crewmen apiece hang from ropes over a deep chasm]
[Will is in the same cage with Gibbs, Cotton, Marty, and two others] 
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is their chief.
Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their chief.
But he only remains chief as long as he *acts* like a chief.
So he had no choice.
He's a captive then as much as the rest of us.
Worse,,,
as it turns out.
See, the Pelegostos believe that Jack is a *god* in human form, and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison.
[Cotton bites Gibbs' fingers to illustrate] 
Argh!
They'll roast him and eat him.
Where's the rest of the crew?
These cages we're in,,,
weren't built 'til *after* we got here.
[Will was gripping the bars made of human bones, but quickly pulls his hand away] 
The feast is about to begin.
Jack's life will end,,,
when the drums stop.
Well, we can't just sit here and wait then, can we?
Scene: ISLAND: throne [cannibal drums are pounding] 
No/Oup!
No no!
Oy!
/Wait!
No no!
More wood!
Big fire!
*Big* fire!
I am chief!
Want big fire!
Come on!
Oy!
/Boy!
Maboogie snickel-snickel.
Tout de suite!
Come on!
More wood!
[the cannibal standing next to Jack leaves to put more wood on the fire]
[the cannibals put large pieces of wood on the fire]
[the cannibals turn around to find that Jack is gone] 
Scene: ISLAND: Jack [Jack is running across a foot bridge]
[Jack runs up to a cliff edge, totters at the edge, looking down]
[Jack examines a length of bamboo pole he finds lying there]
[Jack goes into a hut, sees various supplies, the sound of buzzing flies is heard]
[Jack picks up a rope, starts to exit, halts, looks back inside]
[Jack goes back in, picks up a can of paprika with the logo on the bottom]
[Jack walks outside the hut, the entire tribe is waiting silently outside, staring at him] 
Oh bugger.
[Jack drops his coil of rope, sprinkles paprika on his armpits] 
Little seasoning.
Eh?
[Jack is now tied up to a bamboo pole and hanging face down over a pile of wood]
[cannibals are dancing wildly] 
Well done.
Scene: ISLAND: cages [the men begin swinging the cages with increasingly wide arcs]
[both cages finally come within reach of the cliff, they grab vines and hang on to the cliff] 
Put your legs through, start to climb!
Agh!
Come on men!
It'll take all of-us/the-rest to crew the Black Pearl!
Actually, you won't need everyone.'
Bout six would do!
Ohhh,,,
dear.
[Gibbs nods] 
Hurry!
[each cage group begins racing against each other up the cliff] 
Come on!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Come on!
Give it all you got!
[a cannibal crosses the rope bridge] 
Hey!
Hey ### Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Shhh!
Shhh!
[the cannibal crosses rope bridge] 
Shhh!
[one cage group decides to take the risk of climbing, despite the nearby cannibal] 
What's he doing?
Stop!,,,
[one of the men in the climbing cage grabs a coral snake from the cliff instead of a vine]
[p.
50]
[when the man holding the snake lets go, their cage falls, the rope breaks, and their cage falls to the bottom] 
Move!
throne [drums pounding, a cannibal crosses a bridge to the bonfire area] 
Ahhh!
Fye-fye!
Ahhh!
Fye-fye!
[the cannibal from the bridge arrives to tell the tribe of the men in cages escaping] 
Da latazo!
Da litozo!
Hay la paka say-say.
[the crowd stands silently, not knowing whether to stay or to chase the escapees] 
Well, go on!
Go get them!
Hay ala!
Hay ala!
Ala, ala!
[cannibals run off to chase after men who escaped from cages]
[in their haste one cannibal drops a lighted torch need the pile of wood under Jack] 
No!
No no!
Oy!
No no!
[the edges of the wood begin to catch fire] 
Not good.
[Jack blows futilely at the igniting wood] Scene: ISLAND: cage [the remaining cage reaches the top of the cliff] 
Cut it loose!
Find a rock!
[Will manages to sever the cage's cable by hammering it with a rock]
[the men in Will's cage are unable to the cage open in time before the cannibals will reach them] 
Roll the cage!
[the cage rolls down the hill]
[the cage falls over the edge of a tiny cliff]
[the cage rolls down the hill, rolls up a coconut palm trunk, crashes to the ground, unbroken] 
Lift the cage!
Hurry!
Come on, men!
Lift it like a lady's skirt!
[the men begin running with their legs protruding from the cage, holding up the cage]
[Marty's short legs make a running motion but are unable to reach the ground] 
Come on!
Scene: ISLAND: hut [Jack is running off with the bamboo pole tied to his back]
[Jack encounters the cannibal boy, standing silently with a fork and a knife, one in each hand]
[Jack grabs the knife from the boy, and begins cutting his rope off]
[two cannibal women appear]
[Jack charges, but the bamboo pole on his back spears a coconut in a pile near the cliff edge]
[Jack turns suddenly, which flings the coconut off the end of the pole into a cannibal's face]
[the cannibal slowly lifts the dripping coconut off his face, scowling at Jack] 
Scene: ISLAND: cage [the cage rolls over a ledge into a small chasm holding a river]
[cannibals throw spears and shoot arrows at the men in the water, the men swim underwater] 
This way, lads!
Scene: ISLAND: Jack [the two cannibal women throw numerous fruits at Jack while the pole is still on his back]
[several of the fruits become impaled along the pole, making Jack look like he's part of a shish-ka-bob] 
Da litozo!
Da litozo!
[Jack pole vaults across the chasm, barely lands on the other edge safely]
[but the fruit slides down to the end of his pole, putting weight on the end over the chasm]
[Jack falls into the chasm, screaming]
[Jack's pole catches between the two walls of a chasm]
[two native women watch Jack fall into the chasm, with disinterest] 
A-geev-nee.
Uh-boogie?
[the two cannibal women walk off, disinterested] 
Bugger.
[Jack's pole slips loose, he falls into the chasm, screaming]
[As Jack falls through the first rope bridge, the rope comes undone but is still attached to the bamboo pole and to Jack]
[Jack is hung upside-down in the chasm when the bamboo pole catches]
[Jack falls through a total of six rope bridges]
[Jack lands on his back on grass]
[bamboo pole comes down at him, spears the ground near his head]
[fruits tumble down afterwards] Scene: ISLAND: beach [only Ragetti and Cotton's parrot are aboard the Black Pearl, Pintel is on the beach below] 
Pull-loose/Unloose the mooring lines!
The mooring lines!
[the monkey chatters, grabs Ragetti's wooden eye] 
Thief/Thing!
Little hairy thief/thing!
Give it back!
Don't bite it!
Unloose the mooring lines!
He's got me eye!
He won't give it back!
Well, how'd you get it back last time?
Excellent work!
Work's half done!
We done it for you!
Knowin' you'd be comin' back for us.
Make/Making ready tosail/cast-off ###, boy.
What about Jack?
I won't leave without him.
Hey!
[Jack appears at a distance, running down the beach toward the crew and ship]
[a crowd of cannibals suddenly run down on the beach behind Jack, pursuing him] 
Time to go.
*Cast off those lines!
* [Jack screams while running down the beach] 
Make ready to cast off!
###!
[the dog is down the beach with Jack, barking at him] 
Good doggie!
Doggie.
[Jack grabs ahold of rigging on the side of the departing ship] 
*Alas*, my children!
This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost - [big wave splashes Jack from behind] 
,,,
Captain Jack,,,
Sparrow.
[the crowd of cannibals falls silent as the ship leaves]
[the dog barks excitedly at the departing ship]
[all heads in the crowd of cannibals turn toward the dog]
[the dog falls silent, whimpers, then flees back down the beach]
[the cannibals chase the dog, shouting] 
Scene: Black Pearl Let's put some distance between us and this island, and head out to open sea.
Yes to the first, yes to the second, but only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible.
Uh, that seems a bit contradictory, Captain.
I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills, Master Gibbs, now where is that monkey?
I want to shoot *something*.
[the monkey screams, drops Ragetti's eye, Ragetti grabs his eye, spits on it, rubs the spit around on it]
[the monkey chatters and climbs into the rigging]
[Jack is ready to shoot the monkey with his pistol] 
Jack.
Ah.
Elizabeth is in danger.
Have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on 'er?
Maybe just lock her up somewhere.
She *is* locked up, in a prison, bound to hang for helping *you*!
There comes a time when one must take responsibility for one's mistakes.
[Will pulls a sword from the waistband of a pirate who is turned around, points it at Jack] 
I need that Compass of yours, Jack.
I must trade it for her freedom.
[Jack pushes Will's sword aside] 
Mister Gibbs!
Cap'n.
We have a need to travel upriver.
By need, d'you mean a,,,
trifling need, uh/a,,,
fleeting, as in say in a passing fancy?
No, a,,,
resolute and unyielding need.
What we need to do is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.
William,,,
I shall trade you the Compass, if you will help me,,,
to find *this*.
You want me to find this?
No.
*You* want you to find this.
Because the finding this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating and your discovering the detecting of a way to save your dolly/dotty belle ol',,,
what's-her-face.
Savvy?
This,,,
is going to save Elizabeth?
How much do you know about Davy Jones?
Not much.
Yeah, it's gonna save Elizabeth.
Scene: Edinburgh Trader [a crewman swabbing the deck happens to notice a white dress tucked in a corner, pulls it out]
[the crewmen are arguing loudly about the newfound dress] 
What's all this?
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have to share, and wear it one after the other.
It's not like that, Sir.
This ship is haunted.
Is it now?'
N' you?
The,,,
female presence,,,
amongst us, yes,,,
all the men,,,
they can feel it.
The ghost of a lady, widowed before her marriage, I figure it.
Searching for her husband, lost at sea.
A virgin, too, likely as not.
And that bodes ill by all accounts.
I say,,,
that we throw the dress overboard, and we hope the spirit finds it.
No!
That - that will just anger the spirit, Sir.
What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs, and then just get it back!
Enough!
Enough!
You're a pair of superstitious goats and it's got the best of you.
Now this appears to be no more as we have a stowaway aboard.
A young woman, by the look of it.
I want you to search the ship and find 'er.
Oh, and uh,,,
she's probably naked.
[the crew enthusiastically rushes off in search of the stowaway] 
Pantano River [aerial view of the mouth of the Pantano River, two longboats are beginning their way up the river]
[the longboats are in a swampy area with twisted roots] 
Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean?
Well, if you believe such things, there's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones.
A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off.
And drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness.
The Kraken!
[Marty turns around at mention of the word, Pintel and Ragetti look at each other] 
They say the stench of its breath is like - ooh!
Imagine: The last thing you know on God's green earth is the roar of the Kraken, and the reeking odor of a thousand rotting corpses.
If you believe such things.
And the key will spare him that?
Now that's the very question Jack wants answered.
Bad enough even to go visit,,,
*Her*.
Her?
Aye.
Tia's shack [bayou with fireflies, and an iguana on a tree trunk on the left]
[the iguana eats a firefly with a quick slurping sound]
[people are occasionally seen standing quietly in the darkness among the trees] 
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable we are.
Were.
Have been.
Before.
I'll watch your back.
It's me front I'm worried about.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
Mind the boat.
 Awk!
Mind the boat!
[Cotton is left alone in the longboat]
[Jack cautiously enter's Tia's shack, pushing the door open slowly]
[near the inside of the shack door hangs a live snake, moving slowly]
[Tia is sitting at a table, looks up from her crab claws, sees Jack in the doorway] 
Jack Sparrow!
Tia Dalma!
I always know de wind was goin' blow you back to me one day.
[Tia sees Will standing in the doorway, goes up to him] 
You.
You have a touch of,,,
destiny about *you*, William Turner.
You know me?
You want to know *me*.
There'll be no knowing here.
We've come for help and we're not leaving without it.
I thought *I* knew you.
Not so well as I had hoped.
Come.
Come.
What,,,
service,,,
may I do you?
Hmmm?
You know I demand payment.
I brought payment.
[Jack whistles once, a crewmember brings in the monkey in a cage] 
Look!
[Jack cocks his pistol, shoots the monkey, the bullet has no effect, but the monkey chatters in fright] 
An undead monkey!
Top that!
[Tia lifts the cage door, the monkey scampers off] 
No!
You've no idea how long it took us to catch that.
The payment is fair.
We're looking for this.
And what it goes to.
The Compass you bartered from me.
It cannot lead you to dis?
Maybe.
Why?
Ayeee,,,
Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants!
Or,,,
do know, but are loathe to claim it as your own.
Your key go to a chest, and it is what lay inside the chest you seek, don't it?
What *is* inside?
Gold!
Jewels?
Unclaimed properties of a valuable nature?
Nothing,,,
bad, I hope.
[a jar of eyeballs is hanging next to Ragetti's face as he speaks] 
You know of,,,
Davy Jones, yes?
A man of de sea.
A great sailor, until he ran afoul of dat which vex all men.
What vexes all men?
What, indeed.
The sea?
Sums!
Dichotomy of good and evil.
A *woman*.
A wo-*man*.
He fell in love.
No-no-no-no, I heard it was the *sea* he fell in love with.
Same story, different versions, and all are true.
See, it was a *woman*, as changing, and harsh, and untamable as the sea.
Him never stopped loving her.
But the pain it cause 'im was too much to live wid.
But not enough to cause him to die.
What,,,
exactly did he put into the chest?
Him heart.
Literally, or figuratively?
He couldn't li'erally put his heart in a chest!
Could he?
It was not wort' feeling what,,,
small fleeting joy life brings, and so,,,
he carved out him heart, lock it away in a chest, and hide de chest from de world.
De keys, he keep wid him at all times.
You knew this.
I did not.
I didn't know where the key was.
But now we do.
So all that's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key, you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass, hey!
Let me see your hand.
[Jack shows his right hand is untouched, but Tia unwraps the bandage on his left hand]
[the black spot on Jack's left hand is revealed] 
Uhhh!
The black spot!
[Gibbs quickly wipes his hands on his chest, spins around once to the left, and spits] 
Black spot!
Black spot!
[Pintel and Ragetti copy Gibbs' ritual, in synchrony] 
My eyesight's as good as ever, just so you know.
[pushing aside cloth door beads, Tia goes into a back room, and searches for something] 
I am justMy little ###, where are you?
### [Jack steals a ring off of one of Tia's tables, beside the ring is a silver locket]
[Tia comes back with an object from the back room] 
Davy Jones cannot make port.
Cannot step on land but once every ten years.
Land is where you are safe, Jack Sparrow.
And so you will carry land wid you,,,
[Tia hands Jack a jar of dirt] 
Dirt.
This is a jar of dirt.
Yes?
Is the,,,
jar of dirt going to help?
If you don' want it, give it back.
No.
Den it helps.
It seems,,,
we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman.
[Tia is sitting, she holds several crab shells between her cupped hands and closes her eyes] 
A touch,,,
of destiny!
[Tia throws the crab claws down on the table to see how they fall]
[fade to aerial view of rocky islands whose positions match the positions of the crab claws] 
Black Pearl [pan beyond the rocks to the Black Pearl just offshore, in stormy weather]
[the Black Pearl crew look at the scuttled ship on the rocks] 
That's the Flying Dutchman?
She doesn't look like much.
Neither do you.
Do *not* underestimate her.
[Jack gives Gibbs a meaningful glance, elbows Gibbs] 
Must've run afoul of the reef.
So what's your plan, then?
I row over, search the ship until I find your bloody key.
And if there are crewmen?
I cut down anyone in my path.
I like it.
Simple, easy to remember.
Your chariot awaits you, sire!
Ha, ha-ha-ha, ha-ha!
Hey!
If you *do* happen to get captured, just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt!
Might save your life!
Bon voyage!
Ha-ha-ha!
Douse the lamps.
[Marty douses a lamp, then Cotton douses a lamp, then Pintel douses a lamp]
[Will sets off in a rowboat, alone, toward the scuttled ship] 
before attack [Will goes aboard the ship, lantern in hand]
[Will passes one dead crewman at deck level, proped up behind net-like rigging]
[Will comes across a wounded sailor, who seems to be in shock]
[the wounded sailor is pulling on a pulley desperately, muttering to himself] 
,,,
up the,,,
Sailor!
,,,
the stench,,,
capsized,,,
Sailor!
,,,
bring a,,,
There's no use.
You've run aground.
No!
Beneath us!
Foul breath!
[behind Will, a crewmember's body falls from a height, splashing into the water]
[Will goes to investigate] 
Hey!
Hey!
[Will turns the man's body over to see his face]
[the man's face is gone, his face is just a puckered piece of skin, which bulges outward]
[the real Flying Dutchman suddenly rises from the sea, nearby the scuttled ship]
[the sea creature-like crew emerge from the surfaces of the Flying Dutchman]
[crewmembers from the Flying Dutchman attack the remaining crew of the scuttled ship] 
Down on your marrowbones, and pray.
[Will engages in a swordfight against several invaders]
[Will dips his sword in oil, causing it to flame, and waves it at the men surrounding him] 
Get back!
Back!
[Will slices open the stomach of one of the invaders, fish spill out of it onto the deck]
[Will battles the invading crewmembers, but one of them knocks Will unconscious] 
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
after attack [the prisoners of the scuttled ship cower in fear, lined up, sitting in a row on deck along the railing]
[Jack is at the end of the row of five survivors total, on the right-side when facing the survivors]
[Davy Jones stomps aboard with his peg leg, underwater view of his departing feet]
[Maccus is on deck, turned so that his back is shown, showing lobster legs on his back] 
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.
[Jones pauses to clench his left hand, which is a large lobster claw]
[Jones casually lights a pipe in front of one of the cowering crewmen] 
Do you fear death?
Do you fear that dark abyss?
All your deeds laid bare.
All your sins punished.
I can offer you,,,
an escape-uh.
Don't listen to him!
[Jones walks over to the chaplain, takes the chaplain's head in his claw] 
Do you not fear death?
I'll take my chances, Sir.
To the depths.
[the chaplain's throat is slit, two crewmembers throw his body overboard] 
Ah, ha-ha-ha,,,
!
[unidentified crewman] 
Cold blooded - !
Life is cruel.
Why should the afterlife be any *different*?
I offer you a choice.
Join my crew, and postpone the judgment.
One hundred years before the mast.
Will ye serve?
I - I will, serve.
Grand.
[Jones looks pleased, then sees Will at the end of the line of people]
[Jones stomps over to Will] 
*You* are neither dead nor dying.
What is your purpose here?
Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt.
What is your purpose here?
Jack Sparrow.
He sent me to settle his debt.
Huh!
Did he, now?
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.
[through a spyglass, Jack sees Jones turn to look directly at him] 
Black Pearl [suddenly Jones is standing aboard the Black Pearl, directly in front of Jack and his spyglass]
[Cotton and Gibbs have knives to their throats from other Flying Dutchman crewmembers who teleported over] 
Oh.
You have a debt to pay.
You've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years.
*That* was our agreement.
Technically, I was only captain for two years, then I was viciously mutinied upon.
Then you were a poor captain, but a *captain* nonetheless!
Have you not introduced yourself all these years as *Captain* Jack Sparrow?
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship is already over there.
One soul is not equal to another.
Aha!
So we've established my proposal is sound in principle, now we're just haggling over price.
Price?
Pttt!
Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth?
One hundred souls, three days-uh.
You're a diamond, mate.
Send me back the boy, I'll get started right off.
[Maccus blocks Jack from exiting] 
I keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.
That leaves you only ninety-nine more to go.
Ha ha!
Ha ha!
Ha ha!
Have you not met Will Turner?
He's noble, heroic, *terrific* soprano.
Worth at least four,,,
maybe three and a half.
And did I happen to mention,,,
he's in love.
With a girl.
Due to be married.
Betrothed.
Dividing him from her and her from him,,,
would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony.
Aye?
I keep the boy.
Ninety-nine souls-uh.
But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live with this?
Can you condemn an innocent man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of servitude, in your name while you roam free?
Yep!
I'm good with it.
Should we seal it in blood?
I mean,,,
mm-mm - ink?
[Jones grabs Jack's hand, resulting in a squishy sound] 
Uh!
Three days.
Three days.
[Pintel whimpers, with a knife held to his neck from a crewmember of Jones' ship]
[Jack looks at his hand, it's covered with slime, but the black spot disappears under the effect of the slime] 
Oh, Mr. Gibbs.
Aye.
Uh, I feel sullied and unusual.
And how do you intend to harvest these ninety-nine souls in three days?
Fortunately, he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be.
Ah,,,
Tortuga!
Tortuga.
Scene: Edinburgh Trader [inside a cabin aboard the Edinburgh Trader, Captain Bellamy is throwing documents down on the table] 
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees, *wharf* handling, and heaven help us, pilotage.
Are we all to work for the East India Trading Company, then?
I'm afraid, Sir,,,
Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters.
A *pirate* port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.
An honest sailor is what I am.
I make my living fair, and I sleep well each night, thank you.
[a white dress floats by the cabin window, outside] 
S-S-Sir!
[they all rush to the window of the cabin and look out]
[they all see the dress float by the cabin window, on its second pass]
[one crewman gasps]
[the men go outside to see the dress that was floating by the window]
[the dress floats like a ghost, its left arm raised as if pointing] 
She wants you to,,,
do something.
She's tryna give a sign.
[the dress sweeps over a lantern, knocking it over and part of the deck ignites] 
Over there!
Look for a sign!
[the crew rush to the railing and look out at the sea]
[Elizabeth, up on the mast overhead, sighs in exasperation] 
Look there!
There it is.
There's the sign.
That's seaweed.
S-Seaweed can be a sign.
Looks like entrails.
That would be a bad sign.
What's that over there?
[Elizabeth is now sitting on a platform on the deck behind the men, pointing at the deck where the lantern fell]
[the men at the railing turn around and look where Elizabeth is pointing]
[the fire burning on the desk spells out "Tortuga" in fiery letters] 
Tortuga [men are tied up with ropes alongside a well, camera pans past the well]
[a man is tied up and being dunked in the well, and is spouting water from his mouth]
[crowded tavern, glass bottles are being shot off of people's heads for entertainment]
[a duo of musicians is playing a guitar and accordion] 
And what makes you think you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?
Truth be told, I never sailed a day in me life.
I figure I should get out and see the world while I'm still young.
You'll do.
Make your mark.
Next!
My wife ran off with my dog.
And I'm drunk for a month.
And I don't give a ass rat's if I live or die.
Perfect!
Next!
ONE-MAN: Me have one arm, 'n' a bum leg.
It's the crow's nest for you.
[Jack is sitting alongside a wall, within earshot of Gibbs' table, trying to make his Compass work] 
I know what I want.
Next!
Ever since I was a little lad, I've always wanted to sail the seas.
Forever.
Sooner than you think.
Sign the roster.
Thanks very much.
How we going?
Including those four?
That gives us - four!
[to the next candidate in line] 
And what's *your* story?
My story,,,
it's exactly the same as your story, just one chapter behind.
I chased a man across the Seven Seas.
The pursuit cost me my crew, my commission, and my life.
Commodore?
No, not anymore, weren't you *listening*?
I nearly had you all, off Tripoli.
I would have, if not for the,,,
hurricane.
Lord.
You didn't try to sail through it?
So do I make your crew, or not?
You haven't said where you're going.
Somewhere *nice*!
[unidentified woman] 
Oh!
[the music stops, everyone stares at the altercation]
[Jack grabs a branch from a vase, carries it in front of his face, attempts to walk out unseen] 
So am I *worthy* to serve under Captain Jack Sparrow?
[Norrington spots Jack sneaking off behind him, points a pistol at Jack] 
Or should I just kill you now?
[Jack ducks back and forth behind both sides of a large post, as Norrington points his pistol at Jack] 
You're hired.
Sorry.
Old habits and all that.
[unidentifed man, to Norrington] 
Easy, sonny!
[someone deflects Norrington's pistol upwards as it fires]
[the ball richochets off the chandelier, breaking a man's bottle as he's drinking from it]
[the man whose bottle broke slugs a man next to him]
[the music starts back up as a brawl ensues]
[one man swings from chandelier, women fight, bottles are thrown against the wall, etc.
] Time to go?
Aye!
[a swordfight is going on]
[someone throws a bottle against the wall above the stairs, Jack ducks as it smashes above his head]
[Jack makes his way upstairs, trading hats a few times along the way] 
Thanks, mate.
[Jack slaps him on the shoulder, the man falls backwards off the balcony]
[Jack halts to let two men carrying another man proceed towards the edge of the balcony] 
Carry on.
Heave!
[the two men throw the carried man off the balcony, then Jack continues on his way]
[the music stops, Norrington threateningly holds a bottle in his left hand] 
Come on, men!
Who wants some?
Form an orderly line, I'll have you all one by one.
Come on, who's first?
[from behind, Elizabeth grabs the bottle from Norrington, smashes it over his head, knocking him out] 
I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself!
[the crowd cheers, and everyone holds up their mugs in a toast]
[men throw Norrington into the mud with some pigs, the crowd leaves except for Elizabeth]
[Elizabeth turns Norrington over, onto his back] 
James Norrington.
What has the world done to you?
[Mercer observes Elizabeth and Norrington from the doorway of the tavern] 
Flying Dutchman [Jones plays his pipe organ with his tentacles, steam coming from pipes]
[the crew are on desk, slaving away, pulling rhythmically on a rope] 
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
Heave!
BO'SUN: Secure the mast tackle, Mister Turner!
BO'SUN: Step to-it/tight!
[Will goes to grab a rope] 
Step aside!
BO'SUN: Regain-yourselves!
/Mind-yourself!
Scene: ### [Bootstrap sees that the other man at the rope is his son, Bootstrap is stunned]
[Bootstrap lets go of the rope, Will attempts to grab the sliding rope]
[the cannon's rope drags Will across the deck]
[the hoisted cannon crashes to the deck, and the organ music stops] 
BO'SUN: Haul that weevil to his feet!
[the crew haul Will to his feet] 
BO'SUN: Five lashes to remind you,,,
to stay on 'em!
BO'SUN: Impeding me in my duties.
You'll share the punishment.
Will you now?
And what would prompt such an act of charity?
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha!
What fortuitous circumstance be this!
Five lashes be owed.
I believe it is.
[Jones hands the whip to Bootstrap, Jones' tentacle curls around the shaft of it] 
The cat's out of the bag, Mister Turner.
Your issue will feel its sting be it the Bo'sun's hand, by your own.
Bo'sun!
[Bootstrap reluctantly takes the whip]
[two crewmen tear Will's shirt off, exposing his bare back]
[Bootstrap whips Will's back five times]
[Will is tossed into a lower part of the deck, partially filled with water]
[Will stands up, wearing an intact white shirt] 
BO'SUN: You had it easy, boy!
Ha ha ha!
I don't need your help!
So I'm to understand what *you* did was an act of compassion?
below deck [Bootstrap and Will enter the interior of the ship together]
[crewmember Wyvern is seen to their right, encrusted into the interior side of the hull, standing up] 
I've sworn no oath.
Not until I find this.
The key.
[Wyvern's eyes open in the coral-encrusted wall at the mention of the key]
[Wyvern, who is part of the wall, breaks his head away from the wall, leaving his brains behind] 
The deadman's chest.
What do you know of this?
Open the chest with the key, and stab the heart.
No-no-no-no.
Don't stab the heart.
The Dutchman needs a living heart, or there'll be no captain.
And if there's no captain, there's no one to have the key.
So the captain has the key.
[Wyvern retracts his head back into the wall, having said too much] 
Where *is* the key?
Hidden.
Where is the chest?
Hidden.
[Wyvern closes his eyes, and falls silent] 
Scene: Black Pearl [the Black Pearl is at a dock, loading fruits and livestock]
[Jack and Gibbs are walking together, Elizabeth approaches from behind, still dressed as a man] 
Captain Sparrow!
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.
I'm here to find the man I love.
I'm deeply flattered, son, but my first and only love is the sea.
[Norrington vomits over the side] 
Meaning William Turner, Captain Sparrow.
Elizabeth.
Hide the rum.
[Gibbs takes the bottle that Jack hands to him, and walks up the boarding plank in the background] 
You know, these clothes do not flatter you at all.
It should be a dress or nothing.
I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
Jack.
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?
Darling, I am truly unhappy to have to tell you this but,,,
through an unfortunate and *entirely* unforeseeable series of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever to do with me, poor William has been press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew.
Davy Jones?
[Norrington vomits over the side, then spits] 
Oh, please.
The captain of the Flying Dutchman.
You look bloody awful.
What are you doing here?
You *hired* me.
I can't help it if your standards are lax.
You *smell* funny.
Jack.
All I want is to find Will.
Are you certain?
Is that what you really want most?
'Course.
Because I would think, you'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most.
And you have a way of doing that?
Well, there is a chest,,,
Oh, dear.
A chest of unknown size and origin.
[Pintel & Ragetti walk by, together carrying a crate of bottles, and overhearing the conversation] 
What contains the still-beating heart o' Davy Jones.
Unh-unh,,,
unh-unh,,,
unh-unh,,,
And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants, including,,,
saving brave William from his grim fate.
You don't actually believe him, do you?
How do we find it?
With this.
My Compass,,,
is unique.
"Unique" here having the meaning of broken.
True enough.
This Compass does not point north.
[Norrington vomits over the side] 
Where does it point?
It points to the thing you want most in this world.
Oh Jack!
Are you telling the truth?
Every word, love.
And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones, is it not?
To save Will?
By finding the chest of Davy Jones.
[Jack hands the compass to Elizabeth, then draws away quickly so as not to influence the compass]
[Elizabeth consults the compass, for her the dial clearly points in a specific direction]
[Jack slowly rises up to peer at the face of the compass] 
Mister Gibbs!
Cap'n.
We have our heading.
Finally!
Cast off those lines, weigh anchor, and prow that canvas!
Miss Swann.
Scene: GIBBS### Welcome to the crew, former Commodore!
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh,,,
[the goat neighs] 
headquarters [Beckett and Mercer are in a room with the governor, whose hands are in shackles]
[Mercer is looking through a mounted telescope to outside the window] 
There's something to knowing the exact shape of the world and one's place in it, don't you agree?
I had you brought here because I thought you'd be interested in the whereabouts of your daughter.
Most recently seen on the island of Tortuga, then left, in the company of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow.
*And* other fugitives from justice.
Including the previous owner of this sword,,,
I believe.
Our ships are in pursuit.
and justice will be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass, and all manner of remorseless pieces of metal.
I personally find it distasteful to even contemplate the horror facing all those on board.
Your authority as governor, your influence in London, and your loyalty to the East India Trading Company.
Shall I remove these shackles?
So you see, Mercer, every man has a price he will willingly accept.
Even for what he hopes never to sell.
deck [slow motion scene of falling dice]
[three crewman are playing Liar's Dice]
[organ music is heard in the background] 
I wager,,,
ten years.
I'll match ten years.
Agreed.
I understand.
Liar!
It's a game of deception.
Your bet includes all the dice, not just your own.
What are they wagering?
So any crewman can be challenged?
I challenge Davy Jones.
[immediately the organ music ceases, immediately Jones' peg leg is heard thumping in approach]
[with each thump of his footstep, gooseneck barnacles retract]
[someone laughs] 
I accept that-uh.
[Jones sits down at the gambling table] 
The stakes?
My soul.
An eternity of servitude.
Against?
I want this.
[Jack shows Jones the picture of the key] 
How do you know of the key?
That's not part of the game, is it?
You can still walk away.
[One of Jones' tentacles pulls out the key from his vest to display it]
[the tentacle puts the key back]
[Bootstrap sits down at the table] 
What's this?
No!
Don't do this.
Four fours.
Four fives.
Seven fives-uh.
Eight fives.
Huh huh huh.
Welcome to the crew, liar.
And be called a liar myself for my trouble?
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar and you will spend an eternity on this ship!
Master Turner, feel free to go ashore,,,
the very next time we make port!
Fool.
Why did you do that?
It was never about winning, or losing.
organ room [nighttime on deck of the Flying Dutchman]
[Will emerges from a hatch on deck]
[Will sneaks past one one the crew on deck, who is sleeping with a bottle in his hand]
[Jones is asleep at his organ, snoring]
[Will sneaks into his room, behind him]
[Will grabs a nearby quill pen, uses it to lift one of Jones' tentacles]
[one tentacle accidentally falls on an organ key, almost waking up Jones]
[the falling tentacle also sets off a locket on top of the organ, that plays a song]
[Will holds one of the staves in his mouth while lifting the tentacles]
[Will finally removes the key, replaces it with his drawing of the key] 
deck It's not a fate you had to choose for yourself, either.
They'll know you helped me.
I take this with a promise.
I'll find a way to sever Jones' hold on you.
And not rest until this blade pierces his heart.
I will not abandon you.
I promise.
[Will sets out alone on a longboat] Scene: Black Pearl [crewmen are scrubbing the deck of the Black Pearl] 
Beckett!
Yes, they're signed, Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company.
Agh.
Will was working for Beckett, and never said a word.
Agh.
Beckett wants the Compass.
Only one reason for that.
Of course.
He wants the chest.
Yes, he did say something about a chest.
If the company controls the chest, they controls the sea.
A truly discomforting notion, love.
And bad.
Bad for every mother's son what calls himself a pirate.
I think there's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails.
Brace the foreyard!
Might I inquire how as to how you came by these?
Persuasion.
Friendly?
Decidedly not.
Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor.
Yet you're the one standing here with the prize.
Full pardon, commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company.
As if I could be bought for such a low price.
[Jack tucks the Letters into his coat and begins to walk away] 
Jack, the Letters, give them back.
No.
Persuade me.
You do know Will taught me how handle a sword.
As I said,,,
Persuade me.
[Elizabeth walks away frustrated, leans on the ship's railing]
[Jack makes an odd grunting noise]
[Norrington walks up to Elizabeth at the railing] 
It's a curious thing.
There was a time when I would've given anything for you to look like that while thinking about me.
I don't know what you mean.
Oh, I think you do.
Oh, don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.
So you never wondered how your *latest* fiancE ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place?
Edinburgh Trader Strange thing to come upon a longboat so far out in open waters.
Just put as many leagues behind us as you can.
As fast as you can.
And what are we running from?
[Will sees Elizabeth's white wedding dress on a chair in the cabin] 
That dress.
Where did you get it?
It was found aboard the ship.
The crew it thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill fate.
That's foolish.
Oh, yes.
Proceededly foolish.
It brought good fortune!
The spirit told us,,,
Put in at Tortuga.
And we made a nice bit of profit there.
Off the books, of course.
I imagine,,,
some of your crew may have jumped ship there.
Why do you ask?
Captain, a ship's been spotted.
Colors?
She isn't flyin' any.
Pirates!
Or worse.
deck [Jones is on deck, having found the cloth that Will swapped for the key]
[Bootstrap is held at knife point on board the Flying Dutchman]
[one crewman holds a sawfish sword as a restraining weapon in front of Bootstrap] 
You will watch this.
[crewmen are whipped, in order to turn a large screw that raises the Kraken summoning device] 
Let no joyful voice be heard!
Let no man look up at the sky with hope!
And let this day be cursed by we who ready to wake,,,
the *Kraken*!
[the Kraken calling device thumps heavily against the sea] 
Scene: Edinburgh Trader [crewmen on board the Edinburgh Trader rush to the railing, chattering, to see the Flying Dutchman]
[Will is on top of the mast] 
I've doomed us all.
It's the Flying Dutchman!
[a loud thumping sound resonates throughout the ship] 
Oh, Mother Cary's chickens.
What happened?
Must've hit a reef.
[the crew look overboard, see bubbles rising up alongside the ship] 
Free the rudder!
Hard to port, then hard to starboard!
Clear the rudder!
Hard to port!
[a Kraken tentacle silently seizes one crewman while other crewmembers have their backs turned]
[the Kraken tentacle surfaces in the distance, holding the crewman who was just seized, he screams] 
*Kraken!
* [crewman rings the ship's bell wildly] 
Scene: ### [music stops, slow motion scene, a huge tentacle rises high over the ship]
[the tentacle comes down on deck, breaking the ship in two, bouncing men off the deck]
[slow motion scene, men slide off of tilted deck]
[Will is flung underwater, sees the body of the Kraken in the distance underwater]
[Will surfaces, climbs aboard a floating board of ship debris]
[the Flying Dutchman comes near Will, Will slides off his board to swim towards the ship]
[view from the bow of the Flying Dutchman, looking at the floating debris, including a face-down corpse]
[Elizabeth's wedding dress is also debris, and floats on the surface of the sea] 
deck The boy's not here.
He must've been claimed by the sea.
*I* am the sea.
[Jones stomps over to Bootstrap] 
You need time alone with your thoughts.
What of the survivors?
There are no survivors.
[the remaining crewmen are simultanenously axed from behind]
[Will witnesses the axing, ducks behind a beam]
[Jones turns around, sensing Will, but sees nothing] 
The chest is no longer safe.
Chart a course to Isla Cruces.
Get me there first, or there'll be the devil to pay.
First?
Who sent that thieving charlatan onto my ship?
Who told them of the key?
Jack Sparrow.
[camera shows Will hitching a ride on the front of the Flying Dutchman, between the jaw formations]
[Elizabeth's wedding dress is shown underwater, sinking into the depths of the sea] 
Black Pearl [Elizabeth is sitting on some steps on deck of the Black Pearl]
[Jack walks over to her, holding a bottle of rum] 
My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled.
I just thought I'd be married by now.
I'm so ready to be married.
[Jack offers Elizabeth a drink from his bottle] 
You know,,,
Lizzy,,,
I *am*,,,
captain of a ship.
And *being* captain of a ship, I could in fact perform a,,,
marriage.
Right here.
Right on this deck.
Right,,,
*now*!
[Elizabeth recoils at Jack's breath on the word "now"] 
No, thank you.
Why not?
We *are* very much alike, you and I.
I and you.
Us.
Oh.
Except for a sense of honor, and decency and-and a moral center.
And personal hygiene.
[Jack smells his armpits] 
Trifles.
You *will* come over to my side, I know it.
You seem very certain.
One word love: curiosity.
You long for freedom.
You long to do what you want to do because you want it.
To act on selfish impulse.
You want to see what it's like.
One day, you won't be able to resist.
Why doesn't your Compass work?
Uh my Compass works fine.
Because you and I *are* alike, and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it.
To do the right thing.
I *love* those moments.
I like to wave at them as they pass by.
You'll have the chance to do something,,,
something courageous.
And when you do, you'll discover something: that you're a good man.
All evidence to the contrary.
I have faith in you.
Want to know why?
Do tell, dearie.
Curiosity.
You're going to want it.
A chance to be admired.
And gain the rewards that follow.
You won't be able to resist.
You're going to want to know,,,
what it tastes like.
I *do* want to know what it tastes like.
But - seeing as you're a good man I know you will *never* put me in a position that would compromise my honor.
[Jack stares in horror as the black spot boils back into view on his hand, Elizabeth doesn't notice] 
I'm proud of you, Jack.
Land ho!
I want my jar of dirt.
Scene: Longboat [Pintel and Ragetti are rowing a longboat with key members of the crew inside]
[Jack in the bow, Elizabeth and Norrington are in the back] 
You're pullin' too fast.
You're pulling too slow.
We don't want the Kraken to catch us.
I'm savin' me strength for when it comes.
And I don't think it's Krack-en, anyways.
I always heard it said Kray-kin.
What, with a long A?
Aye.
No-no-no-no-no-no-no.
Krock-en's how it's pronounced in the original Scandinavian, and Krack-en's closer to that.
Well we ain't original Scandinavians, are we?
Kray-ken!
It's a mythological creature, I can calls it what I wants.
beach [their longboat arrives at the beach, Jack disembarks and begins to walk off] 
Guard the boat, mind the tide,,,
Don't touch my dirt.
[Elizabeth is walking in some sand dunes near the beach, using the compass] 
This doesn't work.
And it *certainly* doesn't show you what you want most.
[Elizabeth sits down on the sand, and sets the compass down on the sand, the needle points to her] 
Yes it *does*.
You're sitting on it!
Beg your pardon?
Move.
[they start digging under where Elizabeth was sitting]
[Pintel and Ragetti are by the boat, clowning around, Ragetti is balancing a shovel on one hand] 
"Mind the tide."
I can/may join the circus!
Don't mind if I shine your shoes, Sir?
deck [Jones is watching Pintel and Ragetti on the beach through a spyglass] 
They're here.
And I cannot step foot on land again for near of a decade.
Then trust us to act in your stead.
I'll trust you know what awaits should you *fail*!
Down, then!
[ugly, nondescript crewmember] 
Down!
Down!
[view from the deck of the Flying Dutchman as it submerges, some underwater footage]
[Pintel and Ragetti are astounded to see the ship submerge in the distance, Ragetti's balanced shovel falls]
[Pintel and Ragetti run off to warn the others] 
Scene: ###!
beach [Norrington is digging in the sand, Jack sits in a lotus position nearby on a sandy slope]
[while digging, Norrington's shovel hits something hard, they brush off sand to reveal a chest]
[they remove the chest from the sand]
[the chest contains a pearl necklace, documents, and a smaller chest, among other things]
[Elizabeth opens up a letter with a wax seal, and reads it to herself]
[they all bend near to put their ears to the small chest, and they hear a heartbeat] 
It's real!
You actually *were* telling the truth.
I do that quite a lot.
Yet people are always surprised.
With good reason!
[Will has unexpectedly appeared on the beach, walking up toward them] 
Will!
You're alright!
Thank God!
I came to find you!
[Will and Elizabeth kiss] 
How did you get here?
Sea turtles, mate.
A pair of them, strapped to my feet.
Not so easy, is it?
But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
You do?
After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones.
What?
What?
I was reunited with my father.
Oh!
Well,,,
you're welcome, then.
Everything you said to me,,,
every word, was a lie!
Pretty much.
Time and tide, love.
[Will stoops down with the key to open the chest] 
Oy!
What're you doing?
I'm gonna kill Jones.
[Jack draws his sword, points it at Will] 
Can't let you do that, William.'
Cause if Jones is dead, who's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?
Now.
If you please: The key.
[Will backs up slowly, then suddenly draws Elizabeth's sword, points it at Jack] 
I keep the promises I make, Jack.
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.
[Norrington draws his sword, points it at Will] 
I can't let you do that, either.
So sorry.
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
[Norrington points his sword at Jack] 
Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest.
I deliver it, and get my life back.
Ah.
The dark side of ambition.
Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption.
Stop it!
Be careful!
[various dueling interjections] 
Jack!
Guard the chest!
[duel halts for a second] 
*No*!
[duel resumes] 
This is bar-*baric*!
This is *no* way for grown men to settle - !
Oh!
Fine!
Let's just - *pull* out our swords and start *banging* away at each other!
*This will solve everything!
* I've had it!
I've had enough!
Wobbly-legged, rum-soaked,,,
*pirates*!
[Elizabeth throws a rock at the duelists, but the rock goes far to the left of them] 
How'd this go all screwy?
Enough!
Well, each wants the chest for hisself, don't 'e?
Mister Norrington, I think he's tryna regain a bit of honor.
Old Jack's lookin' to trade it, save his own skin.
And Turner there - I figure 'e's tryna,,,
settle some unresolved business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father.
Sad.
That chest must be worth more 'n a shiny penny.
Oh!
Tsk-tsk-tsk.
Terrible temptation.
If we was any kind of *decent*, we'd remove temptation from their path.
[Pintel and Ragetti giggle and run off to steal the small chest] 
Will!
*Enough!
* [Elizabeth is panting from exasperation and exhaustion] 
Oh!
Oh,,,
!
The heat!
[Elizabeth pretends to faint, which knocks off her hat]
[Elizabeth watches sideways as the duelists continue fighting, oblivious to her]
[Elizabeth soon sits up, puts on her hat]
[Pintel & Ragetti run by in the distance behind her, with the chest]
[Elizabeth sees Pintel & Ragetti, and goes to chase them]
[various duel scenes on the beach] 
Bugger!
[Norrington kicks sand in Will's face] 
By your leave, Mister Turner.
[Norrington runs off to chase Jack up the hill]
[the crew of Flying Dutchman emerge from the shallows]
[one crewmember holds chain shot as a weapon] 
church [Jack and Norrington run through bushes on the beach, then up to a dilapidated stone church on the hill]
[P2]
[Norrington chases Jack up steps inside the building, Jack kicks Norrington back down with his foot]
[Jack and Norrington have a swordfight on the inside steps]
[Jack grabs hold of the bell rope, which carries him downward, and carries Will upward, who just arrived] 
By *your* leave, Mister Norrington.
[the Flying Dutchman crew on shore are at the large chest and look up to the ringing bell in the building on the hill]
[while Norrington and Will are dueling on top of the roof, Jack deftly grabs the dangling key away from Norrington's hand]
[noticing the key gone, Norrington then turns and duels with Jack]
[soon Norrington knocks Jack's sword from Jack's hand, the sword is flung onto the ground below] 
Do excuse me while I kill the man who ruined my life.
Be my guest.
Let us examine that claim for a moment, former Commodore, shall we?
Who was it, who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars, saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take your dearly beloved all to hisself, hey?
So who's fault is it, *really*, that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates?
Enough!
[Jack somersaults off the roof to escape, Norrington turns to Will] 
Unfortunately, Mister Turner,,,
He's *right*!
[Norrington and Will resume their part of the rooftop duel] 
Still rooting for you, mate!
[Jack picks up his sword from the ground, and puts the key around his neck]
[Jack walks through a graveyard, falls into an open grave] 
Wup!
[Jack stands up in the bottom of the hole] 
Oh.
[Norrington backs Will onto the top of the mill's waterwheel]
[the axle of the wheel breaks off with Norrington and Jack dueling on top]
[Jack is facing the other direction, so is unaware of the freed wheel rolling behind him]
[the wheel crashes through a small fence, turns, and rolls directly towards Jack]
[the waterwheel rolls over Jack, and Jack is pulled into the inside of the wheel] 
Woah!
[the key that Jack had around his neck falls off into the wheel]
[Jack struggles to grab the key, which is caught and dangling inside the rolling wheel]
[Jack finally grabs the key, but hits his head on a metal bar inside the wheel, and falls off the wheel]
[Pintel & Ragetti are running off with the small chest, each holding one side, giggling]
[Elizabeth steps in front Pintel & Ragetti, confronting them, halts, panting]
[Pintel & Ragetti drop the chest, pull their swords on Elizabeth]
[Elizabeth reaches for her sword, but it's gone] 
'Ello, Poppet.
[Pintel & Ragetti slowly advance on Elizabeth, she slowly retreats while facing them]
[they all pause for a moment to watch the wheel roll by with the duel on top]
[Jack is running behind the wheel, trying to catch up and get the key that is still inside]
[Pintel shrugs, Pintel and Ragetti resume advancing on Elizabeth]
[suddenly a thrown axe embeds itself in a coconut palm next to Elizabeth]
[all three turn to see Jones' crew crashing through the bushes toward them]
[swordfight ensues with the Flying Dutchmen crew and Pintel and Ragetti]
[Norrington and Will continue fighting atop the rolling wheel]
[Jack grabs hold of a palm frond on a coconut palm while at the top of the wheel]
[the wheel continues on, Jack hangs from the frond, then drops to the ground] 
Sword!
Sword!
[a sword is thrown to Elizabeth, just in time] 
Sword!
[a sword is thrown to Pintel, just in time] 
Sword!
[a sword is thrown to Ragetti, just in time]
[Jack sees Hadrus running alone through the palms, carrying the small chest]
[Jack picks up a coconut, whirls it a moment, then throws it at Hadrus]
[Hadrus' (conch shell) head is knocked off by the coconut]
[Hadrus' head lies on the ground, attempting to give orders to the rest of his body to find the head] 
Aya!
Uh seech!
Aunido!
Aunido!
Follow my voice!
Follow my voice!
To the left, uh,,,
No, to the right,,,
Go to the left,,,
[Hadrus' headless body walks into a coconut palm] 
No,,,
That's a tree.
Oh, shut it.
[Jack unlocks the small chest with the key, square security bolts suddenly protrude when opened]
[the heart is inside, beating]
[crewmen of the Flying Dutchman approach, Jack tucks the heart into his vest]
[Elizabeth uses two swords together, one in each hand, to stab backwards and kill two attacking crewmen] beach [Jack is the first to arrive back at the longboat on the beach] 
Jar of dirt!
[Jack opens his jar of dirt, dumps out some dirt, puts the heart in the jar, scoops handfuls of dirt back into the jar]
[a Flying Dutchman crewmember arrives at the boat, Jack fights him using an oar]
[the swordfight is carried to the beach as the Black Pearl crew attempts to escape by longboat]
[Norrington arrives at the longboat, while others are fighting he takes the heart from the jar, puts it under his vest]
[the rolling waterwheel reaches the beach, rolls out into the shallows, falls on its side]
[Norrington and Will walk away from it, wobbling from dizziness] 
Right!
[Pintel & Ragetti attempt to escape by longboat, but Will blocks their progress]
[Pintel & Ragetti reach for their swords, to find their swords gone]
[Pintel & Ragetti grab a fishnet and oar as weapons against Will] 
Come on, Turner!
[Jack fights with Koleniko, using an oar, subdues him]
[Will sees the key in the chest, Jack notices Will looking at the key and chest]
[Jack hits Will on the head with the our, which knocks him out] 
Leave him lie!
Unless you plan on using him to hit something with.
We're not getting out of this.
Not with the chest.
Into the boat.
[Norrington takes the chest] 
You're mad.
Don't wait for me.
Uh, I say we respect his final wish.
Aye!
[the remaining Black Pearl crew escape by longboat]
[Hadrus is holding his conch shell head under one arm, the head speaks to Norrington] 
Your bravery is wasted.
I shall pry the chest away from your cold,,,
dead,,,
hands.
[Norrington pauses, looks around] 
Here you go!
Oo!
[Norrington flees, Hadrus drops his head onto the ground when catching the chest]
[Hadrus' crewmates laugh and walk off with Hadrus' body, ignoring Hadrus' head] 
Uh!
Ando!
Aunido!
Aunido!
Pirates!
[the face inside Hadrus' head turns around, turns into a hermit crab, extends its legs]
[the hermit crab head crawls after its departing body and crew] 
Vengo kowmpenay lachay.
Hey!
Hovaya!
Black Pearl [Will, lying flat on the deck, head over a grate, returns to consciousness aboard the Black Pearl] 
What happened to the chest?
Norrington took it to draw them off.
You're pulling too hard!
You're not pulling hard enough!
Where's the Commodore?
He fell behind.
My prayers be with him.
Best not wallow in our grief.
The bright side is: You're back.
And made it off free and clear.
[the Flying Dutchman suddenly surfaces alongside them] 
Lord almighty.
us.
I'll handle this, mate.
Hey!
Fishface!
Lose something?
Hey?
Oup!
[Jack falls down the stairs of the Pearl, crew says "Ooh!"
] Got it!
[Jack stands up, struts across the deck, holding his jar of dirt] 
Come to negotiate, eh, have you, you slimy git?
Look what I got.
I got a jar of dirt!
I got a jar of dirt!
And guess what's inside it?
Enough!
[the Flying Dutchman's cannon covers slide down, cannons emerge from the holes] 
Hard to starboard.
*Hard to starboard!
* Brace up the foreyard!
Hard to starboard!
Send his beloved Pearl back to the depths!
Fire!
[a heavy cannonade fires from the Flying Dutchman, blowing large holes in the Black Pearl]
[Pintel and Ragetti look through the gaping hole in the stern, see the Flying Dutchman following them] 
She's on us!
She's on us!
Let them taste the triple guns.
[cage-faced crewmember] 
Aye, Captain.
[triple-barreled cannon fires, barrel rotates after each blast] 
Come on, ###!
She's falling behind!
Aye, and we've got her!
We're the faster?
Against the wind the Dutchman beats us.
That's how she takes her prey.
But *with* the wind,,,
We rob her advantage.
Ah!
deck They're out of range!
Break out run ### We giving up, Sir?
[crewmen of the Flying Dutchman are whipped to raise the Kraken calling device] 
Scene: They're giving up!
Yay!
[crew cheers] 
My father is *on* that ship.
If we can outrun her, we can take her.
We should turn and fight.
Why fight when you can negotiate?
All one needs,,,
is the proper leverage.
[suddenly the Black Pearl is badly jarred]
[Jack's jar of dirt falls to the deck, breaks open, spills all the dirt]
[Jack runs down to the spilled dirt, searches frantically for the heart, which is gone] 
Where is it?
Where is the thump-thump?
We must've hit the reef!
No.
It's not a reef!
Get away from the rail!
What is it?
The Kraken.
To arms!
All guns, defend the masts!
It'll attack the starboard.
I've seen it before.
Break out the cannons and hold for my signal.
[with a deep rumbling sound, the Kraken's tentacles slowly crawl up the hull] 
Easy, boys!
Will?
[the tentacles rise higher] 
Steady!
Steady.
Will?
[the tentacles start feeling around the ship] 
Hold.
Hold,,,
I think we've held fire long enough.
*Will?
* *Fire,,,
*!
[the crew fire the cannons, hitting the tentacles and nearly severing some]
[the Kraken sinks into the sea, some tentacles glowing from the blast]
[the crew cheers] 
It'll be back.
We have to get off the ship.
There's no boats.
[Will sees the wrecked boats, then sets his eyes on the barrels of gunpowder] 
Pull the grates!
Get all the gunpowder onto the net in the cargo hold.
[hands Elizabeth a long gun] 
Whatever you do, don't miss.
As soon as you're clear.
[the crew is busy loading barrels of gunpowder from the hold] 
We are short stocked on gunpowder.
Six barrel/below.
Bring it up!
There's only half a dozen kegs of powder!
Then load the rum!
[Gibbs seems shocked, then turns to see the entire crew halted, staring at him in shocked silence] 
Aye!
The rum, too!
[the crew continues loading]
[aerial view approaching Black Pearl, zooming through the rigging to the other side]
[Jack is in a rowboat alone, rowing away from the Black Pearl]
[Jack stops rowing, sees the Kraken with tentacles around Black Pearl in the distance]
[Jack looks back into the direction he's headed, then consults his Compass] 
Step to!
[Elizabeth runs to the railing, sees Jack rowing away] 
Oh you coward!
[another heavy thud hits the ship, crewmen shout] 
Not good.
[the Kraken attacks again] 
Pull away!
Heave!
Heave like you're being paid for it!
[Pintel & Ragetti stand to one side of a cannon port as a tentacle pulls one crewmember through sideways]
[Will hangs onto the side of the net of gunpowder barrels, attempting to attract the Kraken's attention] 
Euh!
Come on!
I'm over here!
Come on!
[Will slashes at tentacles with his sword] 
Shoot!
Elizabeth, shoot!
[Elizabeth hesitates, waiting for Will to fall free]
[one of the Kraken's tentacles wrap around her leg and drag her backwards, she screams]
[Ragetti chops off the end of the tentacle holding Elizabeth]
[Another crewmember picks up the rifle and attempts to shoot, only to be grabbed by the Kraken and flung around]
[the rifle drops onto the deck above Elizabeth]
[Elizabeth tries to pick up the fallen rifle, but someone's foot holds it down]
[she sees that it's Jack's foot, that he has returned to the Pearl]
[Jack picks up the rifle and takes aim at the gunpowder]
[slow motion scene of Jack firing a ball into the gunpowder]
[ball whistles through the air, strikes the gunpowder, which explodes]
[the Kraken releases its hold, burned tentacles withdraw into the ocean, groaning sound] 
Did we kill it?
No.
We just made it angry.
We're not out of this yet.
Captain!
Orders!
Abandon ship.
Into the longboat.
Jack!
The Pearl!
She's only a ship, mate.
He's right, we have to head for land.
'S a lot o' open wa'er.
That's a lot o' wa'er.
We have to try.
We can get away as it takes down the Pearl.
Abandon ship.
Abandon ship or abandon hope.
[the crew get ready to leave the Pearl, loading supplies and guns]
[Elizabeth approaches Jack] 
Thank you, Jack.
We're not free yet, love.
You came back.
I always knew you were a good man.
[Elizabeth passionately kisses Jack]
[Will sees the kiss from the longboat, falters] 
Prepare to cast off!
There's no time to lose!
Come on, Will, step to!
[the kiss is inturrupted by the sound of shackles, Elizabeth has chained Jack to the main mast] 
It's after you, not the ship.
It's not us.
This is the only way, don't you see?
I'm not sorry.
[Elizabeth leans in as if to kiss him again.
] Pirate.
[Elizabeth leaves Jack and climbs down into the long boat] 
Where's Jack?
He elected to stay behind to give us a chance.
[the crew look uncertain] 
Go!
[the longboat casts off]
[Jack struggles with his manacles] 
Bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger, bugger,,,
!
[a coconut and cannonball roll by, on the tilted deck]
[Jack spots a fallen lantern, picks it up with the tip of his sword]
[Jack breaks the lantern against the mast, pours oil over his wrists]
[Jack struggles with slipping his hand out] 
Come on,,,
Come on,,,
[Jack finally manages to slip his hands out]
[the Kraken rises up behind him]
[Jack halts, turns around, faces the Kraken]
[music and sound stop momentarily]
[the Kraken roars, spraying Jack with slime and flinging his earlier-eaten hat to the deck] 
Not so bad.
[Jack spots his old hat lying next to his feet] 
Oh!
[Jack spots his hat, picks it up, puts it on, wipes slime from his face] 
Hello, beastie.
[slow motion scene of Jack boldy charging toward the Kraken's mouth, sword drawn]
[Q3] 
deck Jack Sparrow.
Our debt is settled.
The captain goes down with his ship.
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow can best the devil.
Open the chest.
Open the chest, I need to see it!
[the chest is opened, side view as Jones looks in, his face quivers]
[downwards view, showing that the chest is empty, Jones tilts his head back and shouts] 
Damn you, Jack Spar-*row*!
headquarters The last of our ships has returned.
Is there any news on the chest?
None.
But,,,
one of the ships did pick up a man adrift at sea.
He had these.
[Mercer drops the Letters of Marque on Beckett's desk]
[Beckett opens the letter to look at it before looking up at Norrington, who has been standing in the office] 
I took the liberty of filling in my name.
[from his desk, Beckett beckons Norrington with two fingers] 
If you intend to claim these, then you must have something to trade.
D'you have the Compass?
Better.
The heart of Davy Jones.
Tia's shack [the remaining crew paddles through the waters to Tia Dalma's shack]
[many natives stand in the waters surrounding the shack, holding candles, mourning Jack Sparrow]
[inside the shack, Will absent-mindedly keeps throwing his father's knife into the table top]
[Tia carries a tray around to all of them, offers the mugs to Elizabeth] 
Against de cold,,,
and de sorrow.
[Elizabeth takes a mug but doesn't drink] 
It's a shame.
I know you're t'inking that wid the Pearl, you coulda captured the devil and set free your fadder's soul.
Doesn't matter now.
The Pearl's gone.
Along with its captain.
[Gibbs is standing in the doorway on the side of the shack] 
Aye.
And already the world seems a bit less bright.
He fooled us all right to the end.
But I guess that honest streak finally won out.
To Jack Sparrow!
Never another like Captain Jack.
He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.
He was a good man.
[they all take a drink out of their mugs, except Elizabeth] 
If there was anything could be done to bring him back,,,
Elizabeth,,,
Would you do it?
Hmmm?
What,,,
would you?
Hmmm?
What would *any* of you be willing to do?
Hmmm?
Would you sail to the ends of the eart', and beyond, to fetch back witty Jack and 'im precious Pearl?
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
 Awk!
Aye.
Yes.
Aye.
Alright.
But if you're goin' brave de weird, and haunted shores, at world's end, den,,,
you will need a captain who knows dose waters.
[a man wearing boots descends the stairs into the room] 
So tell me, what's become of my ship?
[Barbossa bites into a green apple, juice dripples down his chin]
[Jack the monkey on Barbossa's left shoulder faces the camera and snarls]
