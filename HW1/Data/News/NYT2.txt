MICROSOFT TEAMS WITH AT&T TO OFFER SOFTWARE FOR WIRELESS DEVICES AND SERVICES.
Microsoft plans to announce on Wednesday a partnership with AT&T Wireless Services to offer software for wireless devices and services, a person close to the talks said Tuesday night.
The deal would be part of Microsoft's drive to sign up wireless carriers to use its so-called smart phone software  -- a pared-down version of the Windows operating system  -- and services that Microsoft is developing as part of its .
Net Internet strategy.
Neither Microsoft nor AT&T Wireless would comment.
The main market for the Microsoft-AT&T partnership is expected to be business customers.
Microsoft's efforts to persuade wireless carriers to use its cell phone operating system have struggled.
It has run into particular opposition from companies aligned with Nokia, which has developed a competing software.
But Microsoft's potential advantage, analysts say, is its ability to link its cell phone software to its desktop PC software, a Microsoft stronghold.
Customers who want access to Microsoft desktop e-mail, documents and calendar information may prefer Microsoft's wireless technology.
In recent months, Microsoft has announced partnerships with wireless carriers like Verizon and Sprint PCS.
